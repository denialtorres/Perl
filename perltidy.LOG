6 quotes or patterns had embedded tabs:
This means the display of this script could vary with device or software
  First at input line 31
   Last at input line 36

First indentation disagreement seen at input line 6
Ending with indentation disagreement which started at input line 85
Note: Indentation disagreement detection is not accurate for outdenting and -lp.

8 long lines were outdented:
  First at output line 15
   Last at output line 90
  use -noll to prevent outdenting, -l=n to increase line length

7 output lines exceeded 80 characters:
 First at line 15 by 10 characters
 Maximum at line 82 by 25 characters
 Last at line 90 by 6 characters
